        <p><b><i>Brodiaea</i></b><font color="blue"> /ˌbroʊˈdiːə, ˌbroʊdiˈiːə/</font>,<sup>[<font color="blue">citation needed</font>]</sup> also known by the<font color="blue"> common name </font>cluster-lilies, is a<font color="blue"> <a href="file:///C:/Users/pavan/Music/Data%20valley/Bb4.html">monocot</a></font> genus of <font color="blue">flowering plants.</font></p>
        <p>One school of thought places the genus in the family Themidaceae, while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8] The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus Brodiaea in the family Liliaceae.[9]</p>
        <p>Brodiaea species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula.[10] They are especially common in northern California.[1]</p>

        <p>Brodiaea species are <font color="blue">herbaceous perennials</font>, growing from <font color="blue">corms</font>. Between one and six narrow leaves are produced from the corm. The bare flowering stem (<font color="blue">scape</font>) carries an <font color="blue">umbel</font> of flowers. Individual flowers have six blue to purple tepals, joined at the base to form a tube with free lobes at the mouth. The outer three tepal lobes are narrower than the inner three.<font color="blue"><sup>[8]</sup></font>

            In almost all species, inside the tepals and joined to their bases are three sterile stamens (staminodes), resembling small petals, each opposite one of the outer tepals. Three normal stamens are also joined to the bases of the tepals and are placed opposite the inner ones. The base of the filaments of the stamens may be expanded into various shapes, such as flaps or wings. The size and shape of the staminodes and of the structures at the base of the filaments are important diagnostic characters. The compound pistil is formed of three carpels forming a superior ovary with three locules. The style which emerges between the three stamens has a three-lobed stigma. The seeds are black.<font color="blue"><sup>[8]</sup></font></p>
