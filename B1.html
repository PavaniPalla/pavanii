        <p><b><i>Bacopa</i></b> is a genus of 70â€“100<font color="yellow"><a href="file:///C:/Users/pavan/Music/Data%20valley/Bb1.html">aquatic plants</a></font> belonging to the family <font color="blue">Plantaginaceae</font>. It is commonly known as <b>waterhyssop</b> (or <b>water hyssop</b>, though this is more misleading as Bacopa is not very closely related to <font color="blue">hyssop</font> but simply has a somewhat similar <font color="blue">appearance</font>).</p>

The <font color="blue">leaves</font> are opposite or whorled, and <font color="blue">sessile</font>. The <font color="blue">leaf</font> blade is regular, round to linear, and the venation is palmate or pinnate. Its <font color="blue">stems</font> are hairy or smooth. The <font color="blue">flowers</font> are produced solitary or in pairs from leaf <font color="blue">axils</font>, usually radially <font color="blue">symmetrical</font>, with five <font color="blue">sepals</font> and five <font color="blue">petals</font>, and they are usually white, blue, or purple. Dispersal and propagation is by <font color="blue">seeds</font> and stem fragments. Crushed leaves have a distinctive 'lemon' scent.</p><h1><pre>Habitat and range</pre></h1><hr>
        <p>Bacopa species are found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world, particularly the <font color="blue">Americas</font>. A few are regarded as weeds and excess stock should not be dumped in warmer regions. Most grow in moist amphibious conditions, though some like<i> B. myriophylloides</i> seem to be wholly <a href="file:///C:/Users/pavan/Music/Data%20valley/Bb1.html">aquatic.</a></p><p>Some of these species are commonly used in freshwater <font color="blue">aquariums</font> and ponds in warmer climates. Most are easy to grow and will tolerate a wide range of conditions.<font color="blue"><i> B. monnieri</i></font> will tolerate <font color="blue">brackish</font> water up to 15 ppt, due to specialized adaptations that enable it to survive in saline environments.</p>
