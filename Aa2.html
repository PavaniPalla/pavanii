        <h1><i>Tripterocalyx</i></h1><hr>
        <p>Tripterocalyx is a small genus of flowering plants in the four o'clock family, Nyctaginaceae. It contains four species formerly included in the closely related genus Abronia, the sand-verbenas.[1] These plants are native to North America, especially the dry desert southwest of the United States. They bloom in heads of several colorful trumpet-shaped flowers. Sandpuffs or sand-verbenas are common names for plants in this genus.[2][3][4]</p>
