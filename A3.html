The genus name is an 18th-century <font color="blue">Neo-Latin</font> word<font color="blue"><sup>[9]</sup></font> that came from the Arabic ’abū-ṭīlūn (أبو طيلون),<font color="blue"><sup>[10]</sup></font> the name given by <font color="blue"><a href="Aa3.html">Avicenna</a></font> to this or a similar genus.<font color="blue"><sup>[11]</sup></font></p>
        <p>The <font color="blue">type species</font> is<font color="blue"><i> Abutilon theophrasti</i></font>.

        <p>Plants of this genus include herbs, <font color="blue">shrubs</font>, and <font color="blue">trees</font>.<font color="blue"><sup>[5]</sup></font> They range in height from about 0.5 to 3 meters (1.5 to 10 feet).<font color="blue"><sup>[12]</sup></font> The herbage is generally hairy to woolly or bristly.<font color="blue"><sup>[13]</sup></font> The leaf blades are usually entire, but the occasional species has lobed leaves. They are palmately veined and have wavy or serrated edges. Flowers are solitary, paired, or borne in small <font color="blue">inflorescences</font> in the leaf axils or toward the branch tips. The Abutilons can be propagated from seed or via cuttings. A. megapoticum is grown as a house plant, but needs considerable light, including several hours of sunlight per day, and moderate temperatures of 61 to 74 °F (16 to 23 °C). The best potting medium is a loose soil rich in organic material and sand and watered when dry to the touch. The amount of watering should be reduced from November to March and the plant pruned back one third at the end of this rest period. calyx</font> is bell-shaped with five lobes. The corolla is usually bell-shaped to wheel-shaped, with five <font color="blue">petals</font> joined at the bases.</p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Abutilon_theophrasti_2015-08-29_5732.JPG/330px-Abutilon_theophrasti_2015-08-29_5732.JPG" align="right"/>
        <p>The flowers of wild species are most often yellow or orange,<font color="blue"><sup>[5]</sup></font> but can be red or pinkish, sometimes with a darker center. The <font color="blue">stamens</font> are fused into a tube lined at the mouth with anthers. Inside the tube is the branching <font color="blue">style</font> with head-like stigmas.

The amount of watering should be reduced from November to March and the plant pruned back one third at the end of this rest period. The fruit is a rounded or hemispherical <font color="blue">schizocarp</font> with up to 20 segments, each containing a few seeds.<font color="blue"><sup>[5][13]</sup></font></p>
