        <p><b><i>Araucaria</i></b> are mainly large trees with a massive erect stem, reaching a height of 5–80 metres (16–262 ft). The horizontal, spreading branches grow in whorls and are covered with leathery or needle-like <font color="blue">leaves</font>. In some species, the leaves are narrow, awl-shaped and lanceolate, barely overlapping each other; in others they are broad and flat, and overlap broadly.<font color="blue"><sup>[3]</sup></font></p>
        <p>The trees are mostly <font color="blue">dioecious</font>, with male and female cones found on separate trees,<font color="blue"><sup>[4]</sup></font> though occasional individuals are monoecious or change sex with time.<font color="blue"><sup>[5]</sup></font> The female cones, usually high on the top of the tree, are <font color="blue">globose</font>, and vary in size among species from 7 to 25 centimetres (2.8 to 9.8 in) diameter. They contain 80–200 large <font color="blue">edible</font> seeds, similar to <font color="blue">pine nuts</font>, though larger. The male cones are smaller, 4–10 cm (1.6–3.9 in) long, and narrow to broad cylindrical, 1.5–5.0 cm (0.6–2.0 in) broad.</p>
        <p>The genus is familiar to many people as the genus of the distinctive Chilean pine or monkey-puzzle tree (<font color="blue"><i>Araucaria araucana</i></font>). The genus is named after the Spanish<font color="blue"> exonym</font> Araucano ("from <font color="blue">Arauco</font>") applied to the <font color="blue">Mapuche</font> of south-central <font color="blue">Chile</font> and south-west<font color="blue"> Argentina</font>, whose territory incorporates natural stands of this genus. The Mapuche people call it pehuén, and consider it sacred.<font color="blue"><sup>[3]</sup></font> Some Mapuche living in the Andes name themselves<font color="blue">Pehuenche</font> ("people of the pehuén") as they traditionally harvested the seeds extensively for food.<font color="blue"><sup>[6][7]</sup></font></p>

        <br><p>No distinct vernacular name exists for the genus. Many are called "pine", although they are only distantly related to true pines, in the genus <a href="Aa4.html">Pinus.</a></p>
